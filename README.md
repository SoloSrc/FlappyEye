# Flappy Eye

This repository is just a Flappy Bird clone written in C language and built
with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for building and [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/)
for dependency management.

The repository comes with an example CMakeUserPresets, you might want to change
that for your own environment.
